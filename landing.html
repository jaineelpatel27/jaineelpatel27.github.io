										<h2>Project Proposal</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Our goal for this project is to come up with a solution that can help reduce the amount of textile waste that is accumulating in landfills at a rapid pace every year. The amount of waste increases every year and pollutes the air, soil, and water, so in order to slow it down, something needs to be done. Our idea is to create a startup organization called Textile Trade with the goal of educating people on this issue and giving them practical ideas that they can apply in order to reduce their personal textile waste levels. The main actions that our organization would take is to host periodical clothing swap events where people can come and exchange their unwanted clothing and get new items in return. During these exchanges we can educate people on how donating clothing may not always be the best option, since many items may get thrown out due to poor quality. The other action we would take is to host workshops where people can come and learn ways in which they can upcycle their clothing (turning old, unwanted pieces into new, different styles) instead of throwing them away. Both of these actions can reduce the amount of textile waste in our environment and spread word about the issue and how you can do your part in helping solve it.

											<h3>Infographic #1</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Oftentimes people think donating their clothes is the best solution to throwing them away, but this is not always true. Donation centers such as Goodwill usually throw out a fair amount of clothing due to poor quality among other things, so there are better alternatives that can assure your clothing wonâ€™t end up in a landfill. The first alternative is to recycle or upcycle old clothing, putting it to new uses. The other alternative is participating in a clothing swap, so you know your items are going to a new owner and you can get other items in exchange.</p>

												<h3>Infographic #2</h3>
											</header>
											<p>People surveyed said they felt better about donating unwanted clothes to a charity shop or shop, but none of them had ever used supermarket community recycling or charitable collection bins.
Moreover, according to Domina and Koch's (1997) findings: some sold items through second-hand stores, some gave clothes to other family members, some met friends at "swapping" parties, and others made new items out of old clothes.
There are also some differences for different age groups. Older consumers say that work clothes are more likely to be worn to the point where they can't be worn, thrown away or used as household rags and then disposed of through household waste.

										<h2>Infographic #3</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The average American discards 81 pounds of clothing each year, which adds up to a lot when you consider the fact that the U.S. population is about 330 million. In fact, U.S. landfills received 11.3 million tons of unwanted textiles in 2018, and that number is rising each year.
										This is a big problem because of the pollution that landfills cause, but with educating and providing resources to the public, we might be able to slow down these alarming numbers. </p>
